    <h2>Some personal background info</h2>
      <p>Born and raised in Montana (Bulgaria not the one here), my family got here when I was at the age of sixteen. Back in Bulgaria computers were not something that was easily accessable. I had just a few encounters with a computer prior to our arrival in the United States. A friend hand down his old tower to me, I believe it was a Pentium III and after I upgraded the processor successfuly, we were on and running.

    <h2>My first encounter with the World Wide Web</h2>
      <p>That very same Desktop tower was where I first got online and was browsing the internet. At the time, I remamber my mother found a Net Zero disc and it said free internet access on it. We were quick to hook up the modem to the phone line and connect, with wierd happy sounds, to the internet. My father warned us "Make sure to check the phone number, to make sure it's in the area!", but me and my brother answered "Yeah, it's a (773) area code it's local". Well needless to say the phone bill for the next two months almost got my mom and dad a hearth attack.
